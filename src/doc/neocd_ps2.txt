Quick Readme!

History:
--------

0.01a - First release !
      	As this is an alpha release, this emulator is in 
	the very early stages of production and a lot still 
	need to be done. Compatiblity rate is low : 
	some games are playable, but others have gfx glitches, 
	no graphics at all, or just hangs up after a while.
	(games like Bust a Move are fully playable)
      	And there is no sound yet.
      	

Introduction:
-------------

NEOCD/PS2 is a NeoGeo CD emulator that run's on the
Sony Playstation 2. It is a port of NEOCD/SDL, the excellent
NeoGeo CD emulator by Foster. Since there is actually no SDL
library on the PS2, all SDL portions have been removed and replaced
by PS2 "native" library.

NEOCD/PS2 is freeware. You may copy and distribute it as much
as you like. Please do not contact me regarding where to
find ISO/BIOS - I can not give out that kind of information.

Current Features:
-----------------

- PAL/NTSC auto-detection (but not tested on NTSC TV)
- Loads games from the cdrom (can be on the same one than the emulator)
- basic pad support

TO DO:
------
a lot !
- "General" Bug fix
- Fix Controller support (sometime stop working after a while)
- Increase compatibility, fix rendering 
- add sound output
- add CDDA support (!)
- add second controller support
- ..... 


Usage
=====
- Ensure the neocd bios (called "neocd.bin") is under the bios directory 
  (it should not be compressed and must be 512kb in size).

- Load the emulator (neocd.elf) using your favorite way.  

- Follow the screen instruction and when you see the "Insert a neogeoCD" text, 
  insert a neogeo cd into your drive, wait a few seconds and press (X) on the pad.

- If all goes well NeoCD/PS2 should detect the game and run it.

At this alpha stage I would recommend to load using ilink/ps2exec or
whatever you want, in order to not burn a CD.
Furthermore I didn't test yet to boot the emulator from a CD.
