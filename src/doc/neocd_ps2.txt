0.03  - Compatibily greatly increased (no more sprites/tiles missing).
	thanks so much to Ian for the very very helpull tip !
      - In game "freezing" fixed.
      - Memory save "crash" fixed.
      - Added 2nd controller support & analog controls
      - Added possibility to disable z80 emulation.
      - Optimized rendering code (still not fullspeed for all games).
      - Corrected HDD/MC support ("should" work now, untested).
      - Checks local "cd" folder before asking to swap CD.
      - Rewrote CD reading/swapping code using Hiryu CDVD library.
      	no more iso9660 limitations (max 31 files in root dir, ...)
      	and cd swap issue should be fixed.
      - Removed loading of memcard.bin (useless empty file)
      - Removed need for timer.irx (not used anymore)
      - Automatically set region (EUR for pal ps2, USA for ntsc ps2)
            

0.02a - Mainly a bug fix regarding the loading/booting code :
        Lots of people had problems while running the emulator,
        so I made a more robust code that should allow it to run
        even launched from your toaster now !
        (MC and HDD not tested, but code is there)
      - Fixed controller bug (was not responding after a while).


0.01a - First release !
      	As this is an alpha release, this emulator is in 
	the very early stages of production and a lot still 
	need to be done. Compatiblity rate is low : 
	some games are playable, but others have gfx glitches, 
	no graphics at all, or just hangs up after a while.
	(games like Bust a Move are fully playable)
      	And there is no sound yet.
      	

Introduction:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

NeoCD/PS2 is a open source NeoGeo CD emulator running on the
Sony Playstation 2. It is a port of NeoCD/SDL, the excellent
NeoGeo CD emulator by Foster. Since there is actually no SDL
library on the PS2, all SDL portions have been removed and 
replaced by PS2 "native" libraries (using PS2SDK). 

NeoCD/PS2 is not endorsed by SNK in any way and is produced 
without the use of any copyrighted material which belongs to 
Sony Computer Entertainment Inc, or SNK, or any other party.   

NeoCD/PS2 should only be used to play games that the user legally 
owns. NeoCD/PS2 must never be distributed with any copyrighted 
games or other material. Any breach of these terms is out of the 
authors control and is not at the authors consent. 

NeoCD/PS2 is a free sofware. You may copy and distribute it as 
much as you like assuming that you respect the above conditions.

The NeoCD/PS2 source code is distributed under the terms of the 
GNU General Public License. 


Current Features:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Good compatibilty (very few games still have problems)
- PAL/NTSC auto-detection (NTSC untested, I have a PAL only TV!)
- MC/HDD support (untested)
- Loads games from the cdrom
- 2 controller support


To-do list:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Improve emulation speed and get fullspeed on all games !
- fix/rewrite ps2 rendering code (gslib/ito ?)
- Add memory card saves to PS2 memory card.
- Add region selector
- Add sound support
- Add CDDA support
- Add some option menu (region, reset, change game, etc..)

If you would like a feature that is not listed above, please 
contact me with your idea (see below).


Usage:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Before running the emulator be sure that the "host" contains 
  the following tree :

  |- neocd folder
    |
    |-  bios folder (see below)
    |-  romdisk folder
        |- startup.bin
        |- patch.rpg 
    |- neocd.elf
    |- cdvd.irx
    |- system.cnf (if burned on a cd)

  Before you ask, if any file is missing : IT WON'T WORK !


- Ensure the neocd bios file (called "neocd.bin") is under the bios 
  directory (it should not be compressed and must be 512kb in size).

- Load the emulator (neocd.elf) using your favorite way. If you 
  burn the emulator be sure to use mode1/iso9669/no multisession.

- Follow the screen instruction and when you see the 
  "Insert a neogeoCD" text, insert a neogeo cd into your drive, 
  wait a few seconds and press (X) on the pad.

- If all goes well NeoCD/PS2 should detect the game and run it.


Note :

1. Concerning loading from host, I use to test/debug the emulator :
     - pslink 1.23b / ps2exec v1.1
   So please try using the same one if you get problem with your 
   loader.(inlink is known to have problems loading it)

2. It could be possible to copy the files from your original game CD and
   to burn them together with the emulator. In order to avoid the ps2/iso 
   restrictions on the boot cd, copy the files under a "cd" directory 
   (the emulator will detect it and run it from there).

3. HDD should be supported but under certain conditions : If used using 
   regular way of loading (CDROM) it won't works if loaded with fakehost 
   or similar applications (since it redirects cdrom calls).


In-game controls:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

PS2         -       NEOCD
-------------------------
Arrows      =     A/D-Pad
Left stick  =     A/D-Pad
Cross	    =    Button A
Circle      =    Button B
Square      =    Button C
Triangle    =    Button D
Start       =       Start
Select      =      Select

L1	    =  Disable Z80			


Note : use [L1] button to disable the Z80 emulation, it allows 
       to gain a few frame (note that fps gain is low).
