	     NEOCD/PS2 v0.02a
NeogeoCD emulator for the PS2 (c)Olivier (2004)
-----------------------------------------------

Quick Readme
-------------

History:
--------

0.0.2a - Mainly a bug fix regarding the loading/booting code :
         Lots of people had problems while running the emulator,
         so I made a more robust code that should allow it to run
         even launched from your toaster now !
         (MC and HDD not tested, but code is there)
       - fix controller bug (was not responding after a while)

0.0.1a - First release !
      	 As this is an alpha release, this emulator is in 
	 the very early stages of production and a lot still 
	 need to be done. Compatiblity rate is low : 
	 some games are playable, but others have gfx glitches, 
	 no graphics at all, or just hangs up after a while.
	 (games like Bust a Move are fully playable)
      	 And there is no sound yet.
      	

Introduction:
-------------

NEOCD/PS2 is a NeoGeo CD emulator running on the
Sony Playstation 2. It is a port of NEOCD/SDL, the excellent
NeoGeo CD emulator by Foster. Since there is actually no SDL
library on the PS2, all SDL portions have been removed and replaced
by PS2 "native" libraries (using PS2SDK). NEOCD/PS2 is freeware. 
You may copy and distribute it as much as you like. 

Please do not contact me regarding where to find ISO/BIOS.

Current Features:
-----------------

- PAL/NTSC auto-detection (untested on NTSC TV)
- MC/HDD support (untested)
- Loads games from the cdrom (can be on the same one that the emulator)
- basic pad support (1P only)

TO DO
-----
NEOCD/PS2 is still in alpha stage, so there is lot to do !
- Bugs fix, tons of ;/
- Increase compatibility, fix rendering 
- add second controller support (2P)
- add sound output
- add CDDA support


Usage
-----

- Before running the emulator be sure that the host contains the 
  following tree :

 |- neocd folder
    |
    |-  bios folder (see below)
    |-  romdisk folder (must contains following files)
        |- memcard.bin
        |- startup.bin
        |- patch.rpg 
    |- neocd.elf

- Ensure the neocd bios (called "neocd.bin") is under the bios directory 
  (it should not be compressed and must be 512kb in size).

- Load the emulator (neocd.elf) using your favorite way.  

- Follow the screen instruction and when you see the "Insert a neogeoCD" text, 
  insert a neogeo cd into your drive, wait a few seconds and press (X) on the pad.

- If all goes well NeoCD/PS2 should detect the game and run it.
  Note that the emulator has currently some issues with detection of some games
  (problem is still not identified, but in some cases cd cannot be read)
  Burning the emulator together with games not working in "standalone" seems 
  to solve the problem (size cd issue) ?


At this alpha stage I would *HIGHLY* recommend to load it using ps2client/ps2exec or
whatever you want, in order to not burn a CD.
